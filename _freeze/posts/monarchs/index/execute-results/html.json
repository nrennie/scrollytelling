Monarchs (who have historically mostly been male) are typically older than their consorts and *'it was not that uncommon for older monarchs to be married off to quite young women if needing a replacement queen after the previous model had been inconvenient enough to drop dead'*. \n\n<br>\n*Only marriages where the monarch's age, the consort's age, and the \nyear of marriage are known are included here. A further 27 marriages are included \nin the full data where the dates or ages are unknown or uncertain.\n\n:::{#cr-main-plot .scale-to-fill}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/main-plot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n:::{focus-on=\"cr-anglo-saxon\"}\n## Anglo-Saxon Period\n\n*802 -
