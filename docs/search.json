Higher GDP per capita often correlates with better healthcare, education, and living standards, which can lead to longer life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation growth is the increase in the number of people in a given area over time, influenced by birth rates, death rates, and migration. Population growth affects GDP by influencing labour supply, consumer demand, and economic productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife expectancy is the average number of years a person is expected to live based on current mortality trends and healthcare conditions in a given population. On average, life expectancy is increasing across every continent, although both the levels of life expectancy and the rates of change can be very different.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancy, as economic growth improves healthcare, nutrition, and living standards. Population growth can have mixed effects; in some cases, rapid growth strains resources and slows GDP per capita gains, while in others, a growing workforce can boost economic productivity.\n Note: lines indicate median life expectancy and GDP per capita, and size of circles represents population size.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of countries with high GDP per capita and high life expectancy are in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. High GDP per capita and high life expectancy often go together because wealthier countries can invest in advanced healthcare, education, infrastructure, and social services, leading to better living conditions and lower mortality rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are few countries with low GDP per capita but high life expectancy. These are primarily countries in Asia which may be due to strong public healthcare systems, community-based health initiatives, and cultural factors that promote healthy lifestyles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of countries with low GDP per capita and low life expectancy are in Africa, alongside several Asian countries. Low GDP per capita and low life expectancy often coincide due to limited access to healthcare, education, and basic services, leading to higher mortality rates and poorer living conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are few countries with high GDP per capita, and low life expectancy.

    "text": "By Nicola Rennie\n\n\n\n\nData from ianvisits.co.uk lists the ages of monarchs and their consorts at the time of marriage. Monarchs (who have historically mostly been male) are typically older than their consorts and ‘it was not that uncommon for older monarchs to be married off to quite young women if needing a replacement queen after the previous model had been inconvenient enough to drop dead’.\n\n\n\n\n *Only marriages where the monarch’s age, the consort’s age, and the year of marriage are known are included here. A further 27 marriages are included in the full data where the dates or ages are unknown or uncertain.\n\n\n\n\n\n802 - 1066\nThe Anglo-Saxon period was marked by the migration and settlement of Germanic tribes, such as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, in England after the Roman withdrawal.\n\n\n\n\n\n1066 - 1154\nThe House of Normandy began with William the Conqueror’s victory at the Battle of Hastings, establishing Norman control over England - a period marked by significant changes in English society.\n\n\n\n\n\n1154 - 1216\nThe Angevins were a powerful dynasty that began with Henry II, who expanded English territories through marriage and conquest, forming the vast Angevin Empire.\n\n\n\n\n\n1216 - 1399\nThe Plantagenets were a powerful English dynasty known for their involvement in major historical events.\n\n\n\n\n\n1399 - 1461\nThe House of Lancaster was a branch of the Plantagenet dynasty that gained and lost the English throne during the Wars of the Roses, with its most prominent king, Henry V, achieving military victories in the Hundred Years’ War before the dynasty was ultimately defeated by the House of York.\n\n\n\n\n\n1461 - 1485\nThe House of York ruling during the latter part of the Wars of the Roses, saw the reigns of Edward IV and Richard III, ultimately losing the throne to the Tudors at the Battle of Bosworth, marking the end of the Plantagenet line.\n\n\n\n\n\n1485 - 1603\nThe House of Tudor oversaw the unification of England and Wales, with iconic monarchs like Henry VIII and Elizabeth I shaping the nation’s cultural and political landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n1603 - 1714\nThe Stuart dynasty reigned in England and Scotland from 1603 to 1714, and the period was marked by significant events such as the execution of Charles I.\n\n\n\n\n\n1714 - 1901\nThe Hanoverian period was characterised by the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, the expansion of the British Empire, and significant industrial, political, and social changes, with notable monarchs like George III and Queen Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\n1901 - 1917\nThe House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was a German dynasty that saw the reign of King Edward VII and his successors, but was renamed the House of Windsor during World War I due to anti-German sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n1917 - Present\nThe House of Windsor, established in 1917 by King George V, has been the reigning British royal family through major 20th and 21st-century events, including two World Wars.\n\n\n\n\nData: ianVisits and Wikipedia\n\n nicola-rennie\n fosstodon.org/@nrennie\n nrennie\n nrennie"
